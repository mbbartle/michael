	<center>Hi! I'm Michael.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>These are the things I'm interested in!</b></center>
	<br>
	<b>Writing:</b>
	<p>
	We had to write an analysis of our favorite Shakespeare tragedy for my english class recently, I really enjoyed this assignment, so here is my essay:
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VMICys2gCpMmGCcswxb5Voa0zyKWnFGQb3WBuEq-60A/edit?usp=sharing"> Othello.</a>
	We also have to write journal entries. These are my two favorites so far:
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NJEXtN4uC_ikCxCvZYj-nHhQ9K-I3fT4"> Meditation and Tyrants</a></p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Running:</b>
	<p>
	I started running three years ago, and did a marathon two years ago,
	<a href="https://track.rtrt.me/e/TS-LAMAR-2016#/tracker/RZN6UYGE"> here are my marathon results.</a>
 I'm also a sophomore in high school, and on the Varsity Track and Field, and Cross Country teams at Verdugo High.
	<a href="https://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=10641911#!/L0"> These are my results from racing with Verdugo!</a>
	This is me collapsing at City Finals. I don't recommend getting sick before a race :D </p>

	<br>
	<p> I'm in foster care, and have intentionally collected any of my family's photos. When the Ventura fires hit this last December, I realized I might lose them all.
	<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bpc7DcvUJUb0dvhDxPY7iJHIZtTwme3D?usp=sharing"> So these are my biological family's photos, </a> organized by relationship, to hopefully be hosted more permanently on here than in my continually changing physical environment. </p>
